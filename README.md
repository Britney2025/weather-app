# weather-app
A form where the user can input a city or zip code to get the weather for that location.
Use the Fetch API or AJAX calls to fetch the weather data asynchronously from a weather API.
Display the weather information on the screen, including the temperature, conditions, and any other relevant data.
Handle errors gracefully, such as when the user enters an invalid location or there is an issue with the API call.
Implement a loading indicator to let the user know when the data is being fetched.
